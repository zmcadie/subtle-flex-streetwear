### Subtle Flex Street Wear (SFSW)

Our Mission is to search out unique high quality vintage wear & collectables and bring them back life so that they can be enjoyed once again by you! From exclusive one off's to those old nostalgic favorites we all loved, we have something for everyone. Our Head Curator, Austin Fishman, takes great care in looking for all those little details to make sure our garments are authentic vintage. Once chosen each item goes through a thorough cleaning process then a nice steam before being packaged up to make sure you receive only the highest quality vintage clothing.
