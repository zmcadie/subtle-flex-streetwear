### Subtle Flex Streetwear (SFSW)

Our mission is to search out unique high quality vintage wear and collectables and restore them back to life so they can be enjoyed once again by you! 

Whether you're visiting our East Van store in-person, or our online store, Subtle Flex Streetwear stocks all types of clothing from exclusive one offs to those old nostalgic favourites we've all grown up with - we will have something for everyone! 

Our Head Curator, Austin Fishman, takes great care and the upmost pride in looking for all those little details to make sure our garments are authentic vintage. Once chosen, each item goes through a thorough cleaning process, then steamed for a wrinkle-free folding before being packaged ensuring you receive only the highest quality vintage clothing.
