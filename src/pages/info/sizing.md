title: Confusing Clothing Sizes or Sizing Clothing Scientifically?

### Subjective S, M, L, XL, XXL Sizing is WTF!?!?!

Going by subjective S, M, L type sizing to figure out what will fit often ends in "This Is What I Paid For, This Is What I Got" Instagram and Pinterest posts. 

Your M us not the same as my M, and I swear that the L fit me last week...

How do you avoid this absolute DISASTER?

### Measure It!

To avoid sizing disasters always go with the actual measurements. This shouldn't change - 40" will be 40"...but a S can also be 40", and so can a L. See what we are talking about?

### What Do I Measure?

Here's an example of how Subtle Flex Streetwear measures clothing:

Length 28"\
Pit-to-pit 24"\
Sleeve 21.5"
