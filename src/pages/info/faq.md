### Are your clothes clean?

Subtle Flex Streetwear inspects each article of clothing and has developed a standardized restoration process for each different type of garment, footwear and accessories we sell. 

### Is shipping quick?

All orders are shipped out within 24 hours of processing payment. We are closed Sunday's and Monday's so on those days we do not ship out, next ship out will be Tuesday morning. 

Subtle Flex Streetwear has a DEDICATED shipping and fulfillment department located at our warehouse where all items are packaged and ready to ship. 

All items are cleaned and restored then packaged in sanitary conditions before being put into our inventory system ready for shipping!
