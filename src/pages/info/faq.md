### Are your clothes clean?

Subtle Flex Streetwear staff have been trained to company standard to inspect each article of clothing, and the company has developed a standardized restoration process for each different type of garment, footwear and accessory we sell.

All items are subject to a strict quality control inspection by our head curator, Austin Fishman, before they are tagged and sold.

### Is shipping quick?

All orders are shipped out by noon the next day, except on Sundays. All orders received on Saturday and Sunday will be shipped out by noon on Monday. 

Subtle Flex Streetwear has a DEDICATED Shipping and Fulfillment Center located on site at our warehouse where all items are packaged and are ready to ship to you!

All items are cleaned and restored then packaged in sanitary conditions before being put into our inventory system ready for shipping!
