We are 2 days away from our opening, OMG, 2 days!!! The whole crew is working hard putting up last minute details and backend store bs. You know, POS systems, Inventory management, "how to" manuals for all of us and employees. Geeze! Who would of thought getting a store off the ground could be so time consuming..🙄

And to boot we are still in this Covid, let's call it cloud. City licenses are a pain on a regular business day let alone this past year. But in the end it is all worth it!

So here we are working away when Austin ( Our Head Curator ) happens to mention "We have a Alex Burrows Canuck Home Jersey with fighting strap to give away". Then he points to a mannequin in the corner no one was paying attention to. "Well that's a door prize." Lol. Now I'm on a hunt for more prizes among all the goodies we have. 😉

Hope to see you all on Aug 1st. @ 102-2511 East Hasting St. 

J.E.C.

P.S. Look for the balloons!!!!🎈🎈🎈
