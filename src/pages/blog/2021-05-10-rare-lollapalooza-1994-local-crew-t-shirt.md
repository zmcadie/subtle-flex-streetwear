This Vintage T-Shirt is from the 1994 Lollapalooza Music Festival. These shirts were given to the local crew that worked on the show. 

Iconic Seattle, Washington grunge band Nirvana was supposed to be headlining the festival, but ended up pulling out April 7, 1994 due to Kurt Cobainâ€™s first suicide attempt earlier that spring.
