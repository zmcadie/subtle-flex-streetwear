It's now festally approaching Mid-night and there is still a gigantic over sized pile of Tee's, Sweaters, Jackets, and jersey - all sorts of goodies that still need tagging. Luckily, they are already bagged, so there is that I guess, lol. 

Austin, Tania, and Me J.E.C. battled away tagging these items and putting them away in their right places. At first it felt overwhelming, I wont lie to you. But I knew there was light at the end of the tunnel. So I tried to keep everyone's  energy up with encouraging words and making sure everyone drank water, did I tell you it was hot as hell up here that night? 

Anyways, as we worked we developed a workflow. Austin, as our curator, was the head and we where his arms. Picking out, from all the other clothing, the right ones for the tags we had at the time. That is the only reason we got so much done, teamwork! We where looking so hard we didn't pay attention to the time. We started work at 11am that day. When I finally happened to look at the time it was 3:15am. We open at Noon and there are still a bunch of stock not tagged.

I guess sometimes there is no light at the end of the tunnel of clothing!!! Lmfao

Don't forget to come in and check us out!!!
