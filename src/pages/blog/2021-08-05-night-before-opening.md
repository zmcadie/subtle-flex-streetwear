![Folded tee's in wooden cubbies.](/img/dsc_7445-edit.jpg "Subtle Flex Street wear folded and packed Tee's")

It's now festally approaching Mid-night and there is still a gigantic over sized pile of Tee's, Sweaters, Jackets, and jersey - all sorts of goodies that still need tagging. Luckily, they are already bagged, so there is that I guess, lol. 

Austin, Tania, and Me J.E.C. battled away tagging these items and putting them away in their right places. At first it felt overwhelming, I wont lie to you. But I knew there was light at the end of the tunnel. So I tried to keep everyone's  energy up with encouraging words and making sure everyone drank water, did I tell you it was hot as hell up here that night? 

When I say hot as hell I mean, water touches your tongue and it evaporates, kinda hot. Crack an egg on the floor and cook it hot, well maybe not the last one but it was really fucking hot!!!

Anyways, as we worked we developed a workflow. Austin, as our curator, was the head and we where his arms. Picking out, from all the other clothing, the right ones for the tags we had at the time. That is the only reason we got so much done, teamwork! After a while number started to look the same.. We where looking so hard we didn't pay attention to the time.  

Descriptions started not to match the clothing, relook up the number to find it was our eye's playing tricks on us, we started work at 10am that day. When I finally happened to look at the time it was 3:15am. We open at Noon and there are still a bunch of stock not tagged.

I guess sometimes there is no light at the end of the tunnel of clothing!!! Lmfao
