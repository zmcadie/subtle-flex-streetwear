**Subtle Flex Streetwear** specializes in *vintage* and *unique* apparel. Before anything hits the store though there's a standardized cleaning and restoration process we put all item through. 

Here's a quick breakdown of the process all item go through before you buy it here:

1. Shirts, Jerseys, Sweatshirts and Hoodies are inspected and noted of any flaws. 

2. Stained items are soaked in an Oxi-clean bath before machine washing. 

3. All items whether stained or not are machine washed with **free & clear detergent**, dried as described on wash tag, hand steamed then left to fully dry, before **folding** like **new** and bagging.
