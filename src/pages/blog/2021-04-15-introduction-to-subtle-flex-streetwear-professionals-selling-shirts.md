1. Shirts, Jerseys, Sweatshirts and Hoodies are inspected and noted of any flaws. 

2. Stained items are soaked in an Oxi-clean bath before machine washing. 

3. All items whether stained or not are machine washed with free & clear detergent, dried as described on wash tag, hand steamed then left to fully dry, before **folding** like new and bagging.
